## Instuctions

In this project - I created a Windows 2019 Server within Virtual Box. When setting up the server I needed to make sure that that are two different networks
The first network is the NAT that will be used to allow users to use the same public IP address and access the Internet.

The second network is the internal network allow users to connect from their workstation to the server.

Once the two networks are created, I need to go login to the Windows 2019 Server
